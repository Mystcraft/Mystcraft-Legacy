# Setting up a development workspace

## Requirements
TODO
- Installed JDK version range?

## Steps
- Clone the repository
- Download the correct version of [Minecraft Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.7.10.html) for the project. Check the build.gradle file for the version number.
- Extract the gradle folder and gradle files into your cloned workspace
- Run 'gradlew setupDevWorkspace' to create a working environment
- Run 'gradlew eclipse' (or 'gradlew idea', if you prefer) to create an IDE workspace
- Open the project in your IDE of choice
