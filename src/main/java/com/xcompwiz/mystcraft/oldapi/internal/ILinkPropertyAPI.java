	 * These functions are used for the ink mixing system. When a link panel is crafted from a pool of ink, each effect
	 * in the ink has its probability chance of being on the link panel. Adding items to the pool change the
	 * probabilities. Each additive has some set of effects with a paired probability. When it is added to the ink,
	 * those probabilities are added to the ink after scaling the existing probabilities. The effect probabilities in
	 * the ink are scaled based on the "free" probability of the additive, or the inverse of the sum of the
	 * probabilities of all effects on the additive. A concrete example: The ink pool currently has a 20% chance of
	 * adding disarm to the linkpanel. An additive is added with a 10% chance of intra-linking and a 10% chance of
	 * disarm. The sum of the additive's probabilities is 20%. The inverse of which is 80%. This means the ink pool's
	 * probabilities are scaled to "fit" in the 80% (.2*.8 = .16) The additives probabilities are then added straight,
	 * resulting in the pool having a 26% chance of disarm and a 10% chance of intra-linking. Note that these effects
	 * are selected independently when crafting, so multiple effects are possible. Also note that the maximum total
	 * probability is 100%. Additives cannot add more than 100% probability total.
